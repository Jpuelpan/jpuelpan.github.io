      <h2>Bio</h2>

      <p>
        Hi, my name is Juan Puelpan, I'm a Web Developer who lives in Santiago of Chile. I was born in 1993, so at the moment of writing this I'm 20 years old.
      </p>

      <p>
        I really love the web, especially the <strong>technology</strong> that is made of. I'm a very curious person, so I investigated by my own about these technologies and I've been constantly learning it since I was 14 years old.

      <h2>Experience</h2>

      <p>
        In 2011, I graduated from a technical high school, where I learned basic Electronics and Networking stuff, so the next year I get a practice job for about four months. Then I started to study a technical career about programming and analysis which I will graduate this year and I want to follow for the engeneer title.
      </p>

      <p>
        In mid 2012 I get a job at <strong>Ewok Ingenier√≠a</strong>, a very nice company, where I learned a lot about many things such as setting up a web server from zero, solving real problems from his clients, very technical stuff. In the other hand, I also learned to treat with clients, going to meetings and work with other awesome people as a team.

      <h2>Skills</h2>

      <p>
        In all this time, since I started to work my inclination has been always to the technical part, for consequence my strongest skills are of that nature. However I also learned a little bit to self management in matter of projects and as I said previously, treat with clients and work in a team.
      </p>

      <p>
        I like a lot to work in the <strong>Backend Development</strong> with languages like <strong>Ruby</strong>, <strong>PHP</strong> or <strong>Python</strong> even <strong>Javascript</strong>, in fact I really like Javascript, I learned a lot with it.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <strong>Frontend Development</strong> also likes me so I can easily handle <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong>, with or without a Framework. I played with <strong>Bootstrap</strong> and others more underground. I made some things with <strong>Backbone.js</strong> and of course <strong>JQuery</strong>.
